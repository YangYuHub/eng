At my last family reunion,my seventeen-year-old sister,fifteen years old brother
and my grandmother got in a food fight with yellow bananas,bule cheese and apple
coffee cake, My mother wasn't able to stop them from making a mess, So we had to
wash the walls and windows and sweep all afternoon long.

My red bird can talk, so at noon she called the thin black cat into the kitchen,
and said. "Lunch is ready! But then spilled her water all over the cat who ran
out of the room, through his small cat door, behind the house and down a busy
street. We never saw him again.

The student could not find his maths homework to show his teacher, so he told
his teacher that while cooking way too much breakfast with his dad, he dropped
eight spoons of pear and orange jelly, a plate and his pencil, pen, paper and
homework off of the table and on the floor and his dog ate it. But his teacher
was smart and knew what he was saying wasn't true.

Once I saw in the Saturday newspaper that a father dropped his young son named
John in a white toilet by accident. It took ten policemen two hours and eleven
seconds to remove him using a pair of glass scissors, a heavy desk chair, a bag
of peanuts and a cold can of grass jelly drink. I found it interesting because I
don't know how or why it happened and I can't picture these men helping them.

When I had a broken hand and was ill last March and April, the nurse at my
school asked me to drink a Chinese green tea with hot milk and flowers. But it
wasn't good. It was very bad and after the first five minutes I opened my mouth
and spit it out while I cried. Now when I don't feel well, I often keep quiet.

Because they love shopping, my American children are going to Japan and China
for the summer season to buy things that we can't buy at home like Asian
dresses, hats, coats, skirts and new clothes, beautiful umbrellas, books and
pretty mums. They may need a lot of money so I am ordering a credit card for
them tomorrow. It may arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Sometimes, my grandfather does strange things. Late last night he swam seven
hundred meters to a ship in the sea to have a party with the crew and their
captain whose birthday it was. He also caught nine fish and gave them to me as a
present when he returned fourteen minutes later. Another time he drove his car
off the end of a road into a river where he floated north nineteen miles until
it sank.

There are these terrible cooking shows no TV every third Sunday. I usually have
to throw away any and everything I learn to cook, because I'd be embarrassed to
serve the things I make to anyone, even my mom. Last time I made tomato, bean
and cabbage salad in a slow cooker with sweet and sour bread, chocolate biscuits
and fruit, but it still tasted like tin!

My neighbors, Mr. and Ms. Jones have a problem, between them they can never
decide whether to turn on or turn off the radio while doing housework; Mr. Jones
enjoys singing and forgets to finish cleaning when he does, but when the radio
is off, Ms. Jones won't stand up or get off the couch - I remember hearing the
noise that they make over there while arguing every Friday- they knock shelves
over, break glasses and lamps, and even point knives and forks at each other.
